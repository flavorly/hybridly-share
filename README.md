A Quick way to flash & share variables to [Hybridly](https://hybridly.dev/) that persist on session or cache & across requests different requests.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require flavorly/hybridly-share
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="hybridly-share-config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
<?php
return [
    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Driver Configuration
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | You can configure hybridly share to use session or cache as the driver.
    | when using the cache driver hybridly share will leverage your current
    | cache driver and attempt to save the temporary shared keys there.
    | A unique key is used to generate the unique key for each user
    |
    | Drivers: 'cache' or 'session' are supported.
    | Prefix Key : hybridly_container_
    | Cache TTL : Time in seconds to store the keys in cache.
    */

    'prefix_key' => 'hybridly_container_',
    'driver' => 'session',

    'session-driver' => \Flavorly\HybridlyShare\Drivers\SessionDriver::class,
    'cache-driver' => \Flavorly\HybridlyShare\Drivers\CacheDriver::class,

    'cache-ttl' => 60,

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Persistent Keys
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Here you may configure the keys that should be persisted on the session,
    | even if they are empty they will be mapped to their primitives configured here.
    | Might not be needed since hybridly provides a persist method.
    */
    'persistent-keys' => [
        // 'some-key' => 'some-value',
        // 'messages => [],
    ],


    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Ignore URLs & Params
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | The URls to ignore by default, because hybridly runs on web middleware
    | Default For URLS: ['broadcasting/auth',...]
    |
    */
    'ignore_urls' => [
         'nova-api*',
        'filament-api*',
        'broadcasting/auth',
        'telescope*',
        'horizon*',
        '_debugbar*',
        '_ignition*',
    ],
];
```

## Usage

You can use the Hybridly Share helper anywhere from your code and share your variables directly to Hybridly.
Keep in the mind that the values will only be kept on the current or next request lifecycle, they will be flushed once shared to Hybridly.
You may also use closures that under-the-hood will be converted to Laravel Closure Serializer ( Previously Opis )

```php
// Or using the helper
hybridly()->container()->share('foo', 'bar');
hybridly()->container()->share('foo', fn() => 'bar');
hybridly()->container()->append('fruits','bananas');
hybridly()->container()->append('fruits','potatoes');
hybridly()->container()->share('foo', ['bar' => 'foo', 'baz' => fn() => 'bar']);

// On Controllers return back()
return back()->hybridly('foo', 'bar');
return back()->hybridly('foo', fn() => 'bar');

// Conditional Sharing
hybridly()->container()->shareIf($foo === true, 'foo', 'bar');
hybridly()->container()->shareUnless($foo === false, 'foo', 'bar');
// Sharing to a user
// Only available if driver is cache, otherwise session will always use the current logged user
hybridly()->container()->forUser($user)->append('foo', 'bar');
```

# Why Hybridly Share?

This package is intended to be used with the [Hybridly](https://hybridly.dev/) framework. 
Hybridly provides a nice way to share variables, but sometimes you might want the data to persist on the session or cache.

Few use cases :
- Sharing data before a redirect ( Ex: back()->with('foo','bar') can be replicated with back()->hybridly('foo','bar') )
- Sharing data from a request that will end up on a redirect or a new lifecycle.
- Sharing data from a service directly
- Sharing data from any point of your code before serving a request/page
- Sharing data from a command/job to a specific user
- Avoiding Hybridly Middleware pollution with sharing session variables back and forth.
- etc..

If you are looking for real-time sharing this package might not be your best choice, and would recommend using [Laravel Echo](https://github.com/laravel/echo) paired together with Pusher or [Soketi](https://docs.soketi.app/).
